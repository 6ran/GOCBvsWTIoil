## Are there any correlations between the Government of Canada Bonds (GOCBs) and WTI Oil Futures?

This is a fun personal project I did myself to try and see if there are any correlations between GOCBs and WTI oil.

Everyday I noticed similarities between GOCB going down and WTI oil futures during the COVID era and thus I decided to do this project.

The data set was taken from the following sites:

WTI Oil Futures: https://ca.investing.com/commodities/crude-oil-historical-data
GOCBs : https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/interest-rates/canadian-bonds/

The data set's range is: Jan 2nd 2020 to Aug 03 2022.

Average yield	Correlation
1 to 3 year	0.76
3 to 5 year	0.85
5 to 10 year	0.90
Over 10 years	0.92
